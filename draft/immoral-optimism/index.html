<p class="blog-post-date">February 8, 2025</p>
<p>On techno-optimism.</p>
<p>Proclamation of techno-optimism as a declaration of faith. But faith will not do.</p>
<p>It is not enough to be optimistic that outcomes will turn out positive for society, we must demand it. It must be made positive by construction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimism is irrelevant.</li>
<li>Optimism is a distraction.</li>
<li>Optimism is abdication of responsibility.</li>
<li>Optimism is privilege.</li>
<li>Optimism is ignorance.</li>
<li>Optimism is trivialization.</li>
<li>Optimism is immoral.</li>
<li>Optimism is fucking useless.</li>
</ul>
<p>Human tendency to frame things in binary oppositions. It is a very simple model.</p>
<p>Optimism vs pessimism, fun vs boring,</p>
<p>The framing of something as serious as technology into optimism and pessism is an insult to our human intelligence and to declare ourselves morally bankrupt.</p>
<p>Why do we do this? What do we accomplish with this framing? It is simply to brush aside responsibility and critical thinking as “no fun”.</p>
<p>The only moral stance towards technology is neutrality.</p>
<p>Optimism must be understood in relation to risk. Optimism calls for us to look the other way with respect to risk.</p>
<p>There are many things that can similarly be framed as being an optimist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having unprotected sex with a stranger</li>
<li>Driving without car insurance</li>
<li>Climbing free solo with no experience</li>
</ul>
<p>For some of these we have the Darwin awards.</p>
<p>Declaring oneself to be a “technological optimist” is to ignore and brush aside the reality of technological adaptation. It’s a naivete we can’t afford.</p>
<p>Optimism is privilege or ignorance or both.</p>
<p>If you look at the changes technology has brought to society over the last twenty years and declare yourself an optimist, what exactly are you thinking about? More to the point, how has Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple, X/Twitter used their power and influence to make the world a better place? If they haven’t done so over the last twenty years why would they start now? To declare oneself to be an “optimist” on behalf of technological development in such a historical context is beyond optimism, it is plain stupidity.</p>
<p>To refuse to engage critically with the technology. To abdicate our moral responsibility.</p>
<p>Neil Postman’s questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the problem to which a technology claims to be the solution?</li>
<li>Whose problem is it?</li>
<li>What new problems will be created as a result of solving an old one?</li>
<li>Which people and institutions will be most harmed?</li>
<li>What changes in language are being promoted? What is being gained and what is being lost by such changes?</li>
<li>What shifts in economic and political power are likely to result?</li>
<li>What alternative media might be made from a technology?</li>
</ol>

With respect to getting left behind if you don’t rush headlong to adopt a new technology at all costs, I’m not sure why people are so certain the proper image is “the train is leaving the station!!!” as opposed to “the Titanic is heaving up anchor!!!”</p>

<p>What has the Internet brought?</p>

<p>Do we have a more well-informed public? Echo chambers, attention economy bringing out the worst in people, news reduced to reporting about emotional reactions and reactions to reactions, algorithm-driven radicalization whirlpools, an explosion in conspiracy theories, increasing division.</p>
<p>Destruction of slow time.</p>
