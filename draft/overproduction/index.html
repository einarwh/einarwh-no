<p class="blog-post-date">February 8, 2025</p>
<p>There’s overproduction. The big selling point for generative AI is productivity. But this quickly leads to overproduction.</p>
<p>As the cost and effort required to produce artifacts approaches zero, we produce more artifacts than we can meaningfully interact with.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the price of artifacts approach zero?</p>
<p>Not really. There is a new problem of filtering and curation.</p>
<p>Is this Maxwell’s demon?</p>
<p>Overproduction. Productivity, but volume is not the goal. What are the consequences when volume is infinite and instantaneous?</p>
<p>It’s incredibly easy to generate more output than anyone can interact with in their lifetime.</p>
<p>This applies both to the corporate setting and outside it.</p>
<p>At work, over-zealous enthusiasts can generate a flood of memos, demos, reports that no-one will look at.</p>
<p>Massive increase in output from people who are unable to distinguish good from bad.</p>
<p>It quickly becomes a denial of service attack. You can’t do anything else than cope with the output. The bad part is that the actual valuable content drowns in the flood.</p>
<p>The tripling of output from the worst f**king idiot at work.</p>
<p>Who are likely to ramp up their production the most?</p>
