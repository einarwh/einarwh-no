<h1>Taking my ball and going home</h1>

<p>The Internet used to be a nice place.</p>
<p>Hobbyist</p>
<p>Social media</p>
<p>Enshittification</p>
<p>User exploitation / User qua hostage.</p>
<p>What do we do with this broken web?</p>
<p>When I started blogging, I wanted a platform for publishing pieces of writing. I did not want a software development project or a software maintenance project or an ops job. I didn’t start blogging as an excuse to write my own blog engine as a hobby project, and I didn’t write my own blog engine as a procrastination mechanism to put off writing. I wanted to write. I wanted to be an end user. Just like I don’t want to be my own car mechanic, I didn’t want to be my own blog mechanic.</p>
<p>Since I started blogging in 2011, I have moved my blog several times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Posterous (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous</a>)</li>
<li>Blogger (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)</a>)</li>
<li>WordPress (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enshittification shifts the balance. Being an end user is less desireable. Your data isn’t yours.</p>
<p>Platforms and products come and go. Things don’t last. Twitter is gone.</p>
<p>AI is sneaking into everything.</p>
<p>No embedded content. Gist for code, embedded tweets, vimeo or youtube for video. Broken links are unfortunate, but not terrible. There’s a very graceful degradation. The link is not integral to the blog post. Broken embeddings ruin the entire blog post. If the embedded code snippet disappears, the blog post loses its meaning. If the embedded tweet is gone.</p>
<p>Your own domain acts as an interface and an architectural seam. I will never move again, since any moves will be a change to implementation details. I can put a proxy in front, no-one would notice. I can move all my files somewhere else, no-one would notice.</p>

<p>Extortion economics. I can have SVGs in my blog posts, but it requires a plug-in to WordPress. I can have plug-ins to WordPress, but it requires a more expensive WordPress plan.</p>

<p>Small web. Blogs are about the content.</p>
