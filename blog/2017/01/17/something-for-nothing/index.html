<p class="blog-post-date">January 17, 2017</p>
<p>I thought I’d jot down some fairly obvious things about values in programs.</p>
<p>Say you have some value in your program. For instance, it could be a <strong>String</strong>, or a <strong>Thing</strong>. Then conceptually, each <strong>String</strong> belongs to the set of possible <strong>String</strong>s, and each <strong>Thing</strong> belongs to the set of possible <strong>Thing</strong>s. Right?</p>
<p>Like so:</p>
<p><img src="/images/a320d3ab92c4/thing-string.png" alt="Things &amp; strings"></p>
<p>Of course, you might even have something like a function from <strong>String</strong> to <strong>Thing</strong> or the other way around. That’s no different, they’re just values that belong to some set of possible values. Hard to draw, though.</p>
<p>In programs, this notion of sets of possible values is baked into the concept of types. So instead of saying that some value belongs to the set of possible <strong>Thing</strong>s, we say that it has type <strong>Thing</strong> or is of type <strong>Thing</strong>.</p>
<p>I wish that was all there was to it, but alas, it gets more complicated. Not only do we want to represent the <em>presence</em> of values in our programs, sometimes we want to represent the <em>absence</em> of values as well. The absence of a value isn’t necessarily an error. It could be, but it could be fine, too. There are many valid reasons why we might end up with <em>absences</em> flowing through our programs. So we need to represent them.</p>
<p>This is where <strong>null</strong> enters the picture.</p>
<p>In languages like C# and Java - any object-oriented language that carries DNA from Tony Hoare’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_W">ALGOL W</a> - the drawing of the sets above doesn’t map directly over to types. For each so-called reference type (object values that are accessed by means of references), there’s a twist. In addition to the set of possible values, each reference type also allows for the value <strong>null</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/09aef60e7582/thing-string-null.png" alt="Things &amp; strings with null"></p>
<p>It looks pretty similar, but the consequences for program semantics are significant.</p>
<p>The purpose of <strong>null</strong> is, of course, to represent the absence of a value of a given type. But now your type identifies a pretty weird set of possible values. In the case of <strong>Thing</strong>, for instance, you have all the legitimate actual <strong>Thing</strong>s, but also this weird thing that represents the <em>absence</em> of a <strong>Thing</strong>. So it’s decidedly not a <strong>Thing</strong> as such, yet it is of type <strong>Thing</strong>. It’s bizarre.</p>
<p>But it’s not just confusing to think about. It causes practical problems since <strong>null</strong> just doesn’t fit in. It’s a phony - a hologram that successfully fools the compiler, which is unable to distinguish between <strong>null</strong> and proper values of a given type. It’s nothing like the other values. Hence you need to think about it and worry about it all the time. Since it’s not really there, you can’t treat it like a proper value. You most decidedly can <em>not</em> invoke a method on it, which is sort of what you do with objects. The interpretation of <strong>null</strong> is radically different from the interpretation of all the other values of the same type. (Interestingly, it’s different in precisely the same way for all types: how <strong>null</strong> sticks out from legit <strong>Thing</strong>s mirrors how it sticks out from legit <strong>String</strong>s and everything else)</p>
<p>But it gets worse. Once you’ve invited <strong>null</strong> into your home, there’s no way of getting rid of it! In other words, when you make <strong>null</strong> part of, say, the <strong>Thing</strong> type, you can no longer express the idea <em>one of the actual, legit <strong>Thing</strong>s, not that spectral special “<strong>Thing</strong>”</em>. There is no way you can say explicitly in your program that you <em>know</em> that a value is present. It’s all anecdotes and circumstance. You can obviously take a look at some value at any given time in your program and decide whether it’s a legit <strong>Thing</strong> or just an illusion, but it’s completely ephemeral. You’ve given your type system a sort of brain damage that prevents it from forming memories about absence and presence of values: you might check for <strong>null</strong>, but your program immediately forgets about it!</p>
<p>So much for reference types. What about so-called primitive values, like integers and booleans? Neither can be <strong>null</strong> in C# or Java. So the question is: lacking <strong>null</strong>, how do we represent the absence of a value?</p>
<p>Well, one hack is to think “Gee, I’m not really going to use <em>all</em> the possible values, so I can take one of them and pretend it’s sort of like <strong>null</strong>.” So instead of interpreting the value literally, you override the interpretation for some magic values. Using -1 as a special value for integers is a classic, in the case where your legit values are non-negative. The consequence is that you now have two kinds of values inside your type, operating at different semantic levels and being used for different purposes. Your set of values isn’t just a set of values anymore - it’s a conglomerate of conceptually different things.</p>
<p>This leaves us in a situation that’s similar to the reference type situation, except it’s ad-hoc, convention-based at best. In both cases, we have two things we’re trying to express. One thing is the presence or absence of a value. And the other thing is the set of possible values that value belongs to. These are distinct, orthogonal concerns. And usually, the word of wisdom in programming is to let distinct things be distinct, and avoid mixing things up.</p>
<p>So how can we do that? If we reject the temptation to put special values with special interpretation rules into the same bag as the legit values, what can we do?</p>
<p>If you’re a C# programmer, you’re thinking that you can use <strong>Nullable</strong> to represent the absence of a primitive value instead. This is true, and you should. <strong>Nullable</strong> is a wrapper around a primitive type, creating a <em>new</em> type that can have either <strong>null</strong> or a legit instance of the primitive type as value. On top of that, the the compiler works pretty to hard to blur the line between the underlying type and its <strong>Nullable</strong> counterpart, such as special syntax and implicit type conversion from <strong>T</strong> to <strong>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>In a language with sum types, we can do something similar to <strong>Nullable</strong>, but in a completely generic way. What is a sum type? It is a composite type created by combining various classes of things into a single thing. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-fsharp"><span></span><span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">Utterance</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Fee</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">Fie</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">Foe</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">Fum</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So it’s sort of like an enumeration of variants. But it’s a rich man’s enumeration, since you can associate a variant with a value of another type. Like so:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-fsharp"><span></span><span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">ThingOrNothing</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Indeed</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">Thing</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">Nothing</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a type that distinguishes neatly between legit <strong>Thing</strong>s and the absence of a <strong>Thing</strong>. Either you’ll indeed have a <strong>Thing</strong>, or you’ll have nothing. And since absence stands to presence in the same way for all types, we can generalize it:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-fsharp"><span></span><span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">Mayhaps</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">'</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Indeed</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">T</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">Nothing</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The nice thing is that we can now distinguish between the case where we <em>might</em> have a value or not and the case where we know we <em>do</em> have a value (provided our language doesn’t allow null, of course). In other words, we can have a function of type <strong>Mayhaps&lt;Thing&gt; -&gt; Thing</strong>. This is a big deal! We can distinguish between the parts of our program that have to worry about absent values and the parts that don’t. We’ve fixed the brain damage, our program can form memories of the checks we’ve made. It’s a beautiful feat of surgery, enabled by sum types and the absence of <strong>null</strong>.</p>
<p>So sum types neatly solves this problem with representing absence and presence of values, on top of, and orthogonally to, the issue of defining a set of possible values for a given shape of data. What’s more, this is just one application of a general feature of the language. There is no need to complicate the language itself with special handling of absence. Instead, you’re likely to find something like <strong>Mayhaps</strong> in the standard library. In F# it’s called <strong>Option</strong>, in Elm it’s called <strong>Maybe</strong>. In languages like F# and Elm - any functional language that carries DNA from Robin Milner’s ML - you’ll find that you have both sum types and pattern matching. Pattern matching makes it very easy to work with the sum type variants.</p>
<p>The code you write to handle absence and presence follows certain patterns, which means you can create abstractions. For instance, say you have some function <em>thingify</em> of type <strong>String -&gt; Thing</strong>, which takes a <strong>String</strong> and produces a <strong>Thing</strong>. Now suppose you’re given an <strong>Mayhaps&lt;String&gt;</strong> instead of a <strong>String</strong>. If you don’t have a <strong>String</strong>, you don’t get a <strong>Thing</strong>, but if indeed you do have a <strong>String</strong>, you’d like to apply <em>thingify</em> to get a <strong>Thing</strong>. Right?</p>
<p>Here’s how you might write it out, assuming F#-style syntax and pattern matching:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-fsharp"><span></span><span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">dunnoCouldBe</span> <span class="k">with</span>
<span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">Indeed</span> <span class="n">str</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Indeed</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">thingify</span> <span class="n">str</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">Nothing</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Nothing</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This pattern is going to pop up again and again when you’re working with <strong>Mayhaps</strong> values, where the only thing that varies is the function you’d like to apply. So you can write a general function to handle this:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-fsharp"><span></span><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">quux</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">T</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="k">'</span><span class="n">U</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Mayhaps</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">'</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Mayhaps</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">'</span><span class="n">U</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">=</span>
  <span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="k">with</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">Indeed</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Indeed</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">)</span>
  <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">Nothing</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Nothing</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever you need to optionally transform a <strong>Mayhaps</strong> value using some function, you just pass both of them to <strong>quux</strong> to handle it. But of course, chances are you’ll find that <strong>quux</strong> has already been written for you. In F#, it’s called <strong>Option.map</strong>. Because it map from one kind of <strong>Option</strong> value to another.</p>
<p>At this point, we’ve got the mechanics and practicalities of working with values that could be present or absent worked out. Now what should you do when you change your mind about where and how you handle the absence of a value? This is a design decision, even a business rule. These things change.</p>
<p>The short answer is that when these things change, you get a rippling change in type signatures in your program - from the place where you made a change, to the place where you handle the effect of the change. This is a good thing. This is the compiler pointing out where you need to do some work to make the change work as planned. That’s another benefit of treating the absence of values explicitly instead of mixing it up with the values themselves.</p>
<p>That’s all well and good, but what can you do if you’re a C# or Java programmer? What if your programming language has <strong>null</strong> and no sum types? Well, you could implement something similar to <strong>Mayhaps</strong> using the tools available to you.</p>
<p>Here’s a naive implementation written down very quickly, without a whole lot of thought put into it:</p>

<p>A better solution would be to use a library such as Succinc&lt;T&gt; to do the job for you.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you do it, however, it’s always going to be a bit clunky. What’s more is it won’t really solve our problem.</p>
<p>As you’ll recall, the problem with <strong>null</strong> is that you can’t escape from it. In a sense, what is missing isn’t <strong>Mayhaps</strong>. It’s the opposite. With <strong>null</strong>, everything is <strong>Mayhaps</strong>! We still don’t have a way to say that we know that the value is there. So perhaps a better solution is to implement the opposite? We could try. Here’s a very simple type that banishes <strong>null</strong>:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-csharp"><span></span><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">sealed</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Indeed</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>Now the question is - apart from being very clunky - does it work? And the depressing answer is: not really. It addresses the correct problem, but it fails for an obvious reason - how do you ensure that the <strong>Indeed</strong> value itself isn’t <strong>null</strong>? Put it inside another <strong>Indeed</strong>?</p>
<p>Implementing <strong>Indeed</strong> as a struct (that is, a value type) doesn’t work too great either. While a struct <strong>Indeed</strong> cannot be null, you can very easily obtain an uninitialized <strong>Indeed</strong>, for instance by getting the default value of the struct, which is always available. In that case, you would end up with an <strong>Indeed</strong> which wraps a <strong>null</strong>, which is unacceptable.</p>
<p>So I’m afraid it really is true. You can’t get rid of <strong>null</strong> once you’ve invited it in. It’s pretty annoying. I wish they hadn’t invited in <strong>null</strong> in the first place.</p>
